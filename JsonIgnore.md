`@JsonIgnore` is essentially a "do not include" tag for your data fields when converting between Java objects and JSON.

In layman's terms:

1. **Hides fields**: It tells the system "don't include this field when creating JSON from my Java object." It's like telling someone taking your photo, "Don't include my messy bookshelf in the background."

2. **Prevents security issues**: It helps you keep sensitive information (like passwords or internal IDs) out of your JSON responses.

3. **Reduces response size**: By excluding unnecessary fields, your JSON responses become smaller and more efficient.

4. **Prevents circular references**: If Object A contains Object B, which contains a reference back to Object A, this could cause an infinite loop when converting to JSON. `@JsonIgnore` can break this cycle.

For example:

```java
public class User {
    private String username;
    
    @JsonIgnore
    private String password;
    
    // getters and setters
}
```

When this `User` object is converted to JSON, it would look like:
```json
{
  "username": "john_doe"
}
```

The `password` field is completely excluded from the JSON, even though it exists in the Java object.

In your case with the `SystemicIssueStatusResponse`, adding `@JsonIgnore` to the `jsonResponse` field would prevent that internal JsonNode structure (with all the `_children` and `_value` fields) from appearing in your JSON output.
