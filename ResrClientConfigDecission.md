The values for `maxTotal` and `defaultMaxPerRoute` in the `RestClientConfig.java` file are important connection pool settings that affect the performance and resource usage of your application. Here's how to decide appropriate values:

```java:src/main/java/com/mathworks/trweb/config/RestClientConfig.java
package com.mathworks.trweb.config;

import org.apache.hc.client5.http.impl.classic.CloseableHttpClient;
import org.apache.hc.client5.http.impl.classic.HttpClients;
import org.apache.hc.client5.http.impl.io.PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.http.client.HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestClient;

/**
 * Configuration for REST client connections.
 * This class configures the HTTP connection pool settings for outbound REST calls.
 */
@Configuration
public class RestClientConfig {

    /**
     * Creates and configures a RestClient bean with optimized connection pool settings.
     * 
     * @return A configured RestClient instance
     */
    @Bean
    public RestClient restClient() {
        PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager connectionManager = new PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager();
        
        // Maximum number of total connections in the pool
        // Formula: (services you call) × (max concurrent requests per service) × (nodes in your cluster)
        connectionManager.setMaxTotal(100);
        
        // Maximum number of connections per route (hostname:port)
        // Formula: (max concurrent requests per service) × (nodes in your cluster)
        connectionManager.setDefaultMaxPerRoute(20);
        
        // Optional: Set connection timeouts
        // connectionManager.setDefaultConnectionConfig(
        //     ConnectionConfig.custom()
        //         .setConnectTimeout(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        //         .setSocketTimeout(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        //         .build()
        // );

        CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.custom()
                .setConnectionManager(connectionManager)
                .build();

        HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory requestFactory = new HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory(httpClient);

        return RestClient.builder()
                .requestFactory(requestFactory)
                .build();
    }
}
```

### How to Determine Appropriate Values

#### maxTotal
This is the maximum number of connections across all routes that can be open at once.

**Formula**: `(number of services you call) × (max concurrent requests per service) × (nodes in your cluster)`

For example:
- If your application calls 5 different services
- Each service might handle up to 10 concurrent requests
- Your application runs on 2 nodes
- Then: `maxTotal = 5 × 10 × 2 = 100`

#### defaultMaxPerRoute
This is the maximum number of connections to a specific host (route).

**Formula**: `(max concurrent requests per service) × (nodes in your cluster)`

For example:
- If each service might handle up to 10 concurrent requests
- Your application runs on 2 nodes
- Then: `defaultMaxPerRoute = 10 × 2 = 20`

### Factors to Consider

1. **Memory Usage**: Each connection consumes memory. Too many connections can lead to memory issues.

2. **CPU Usage**: Managing many connections requires CPU resources.

3. **Target Service Capacity**: Consider how many concurrent connections the target services can handle.

4. **Request Patterns**: 
   - Bursty traffic may need more connections
   - Steady traffic can work with fewer connections

5. **Connection Reuse**: HTTP keep-alive allows connections to be reused, reducing the need for many connections.

6. **Response Time**: If target services have slow response times, you might need more connections to prevent blocking.

### Monitoring and Tuning

Start with conservative values and monitor:
- Connection pool usage metrics
- Response times
- Connection wait times
- Connection timeouts

Adjust based on observed behavior:
- If you see many connection timeouts or long wait times, increase the pool size
- If memory usage is high but connections are mostly idle, decrease the pool size

### Default Values Recommendation

For a typical microservice in a medium-sized application:
- `maxTotal`: 50-200 (depending on the number of services you call)
- `defaultMaxPerRoute`: 20-50 (depending on the load to each service)

The values in your current configuration (maxTotal=50, defaultMaxPerRoute=20) are reasonable starting points for a moderately busy service that calls a few external APIs.
